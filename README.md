# business-card

This was an exercise from the Scrimba program that focused on expanding my CSS and HTML skills.

In this Exercise, we learned how to utilize CSS to improve our websites by adding different fonts, colors, and borders to our images, in this case, our business cards!

Here is a link to the business card that I created: https://oscarbusinesscard.netlify.app/
